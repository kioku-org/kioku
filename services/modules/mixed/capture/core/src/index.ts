/**
 * @vexa/mixed-capture-core — the platform-agnostic mixed-audio capture used by

 * + the WebRTC remote-audio hook; no per-speaker channels, no names (those come
 * from the platform hint watchers in @vexa/zoom-capture / @vexa/teams-capture).
 *
 * Recording (the meeting mix → recording.v1) is a separate, platform-agnostic
 * concern — see `@vexa/record-chunker` (createRecordingTap), not here.
