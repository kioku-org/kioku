/**
 * @vexa/transcribe-whisper — the shared stt.v1 egress.
 *
 * One concern: take a PCM window → call the hosted Whisper service → return
 * verbose segments, with the low-confidence/hallucination STT filter applied at
 * source. Both lanes (gmeet channel-router, mixed segmenter) drive the shared
 * buffer, which calls THIS via the injected `transcribe(pcm, prompt)` fn — so
 * whisper has no knowledge of topology, naming, or confirmation.
