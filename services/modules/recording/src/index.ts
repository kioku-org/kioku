/**
 * @vexa/recording — the recording brick (emits recording.v1).
 *
 * One concern, two halves that always work together:
 *  - ACQUIRE: AudioCaptureSource (PulseAudio parec | in-page MediaRecorder) +
 *    UnifiedRecordingPipeline drive raw meeting audio/video into a ChunkSink.
 *  - DELIVER: RecordingService / VideoRecordingService chunk-upload over HTTP
 *    to the server-side receiver (meeting-api), which assembles the final file.
 *
 * Internal strategy axes (NOT separate bricks): MediaRecorder (gmeet/teams) vs
 * PulseAudio (zoom); audio vs video (x11grab). All host couplings injected —
 * the brick never imports the bot (one-way rule).
 *
 * Contract: recording.v1 (chunk_seq + is_final + format → meeting-api).
